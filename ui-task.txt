Create a new React component: src/renderer/src/components/gemini/CodeAnalysisPanel.tsx

This component should:
1. Allow users to select a project directory
2. Choose analysis type (bugs, performance, security, etc.)
3. Display analysis results from Gemini CLI
4. Show diff previews for suggested changes
5. Allow users to approve/reject modifications

Follow the existing component patterns in the project using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
