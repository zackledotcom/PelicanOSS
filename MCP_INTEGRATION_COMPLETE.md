- **test-mcp-integration.sh**: Integration verification script

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start
1. **Launch PelicanOS**: `npm run dev`
2. **Navigate to "Thinking" tab**: Click the sparkle icon in the main interface
3. **Enter a problem**: Type your question or challenge
4. **Add context** (optional): Provide background information
5. **Set thinking steps**: Choose 3-10 steps based on complexity
6. **Start thinking**: Click the button and watch the AI reason through your problem

### Example Problems to Try

#### Business Strategy
```
Problem: How should we prioritize our product roadmap for Q3?
Context: SaaS startup, limited engineering resources, competing customer requests
Steps: 7
```

#### Technical Decision
```
Problem: Should we migrate our database from PostgreSQL to MongoDB?
Context: High read/write volume, complex relationships, team familiar with SQL
Steps: 5
```

#### Personal Decision
```
Problem: How should I structure my learning plan for AI/ML?
Context: Software engineer, 2 years experience, want to transition to AI role
Steps: 6
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Privacy-First Design
- **100% Local Processing**: All thinking happens on your machine
- **No External Calls**: MCP server runs entirely offline
- **Secure IPC**: Communication through Electron's secure bridge
- **Data Isolation**: No data leaves your device

### Modular Integration
- **Service Pattern**: Follows PelicanOS service architecture
- **Handler Registration**: Secure IPC with rate limiting
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support throughout
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of server issues

### Performance Optimized
- **Lazy Loading**: MCP server starts only when needed
- **Process Management**: Automatic cleanup and timeout handling
- **Memory Efficient**: Minimal resource footprint
- **Connection Reuse**: Efficient server communication

## 🔧 Technical Details

### MCP Server Configuration
```typescript
{
  name: 'sequential-thinking',
  command: 'npx',
  args: ['-y', '@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking'],
  isRunning: false,
  autoStart: true
}
```

### API Methods Added
- `window.api.mcpStartServer(serverName)`
- `window.api.mcpStopServer(serverName)`
- `window.api.mcpGetServerStatus(serverName)`
- `window.api.mcpThinkingRequest(request)`
- `window.api.mcpStopAllServers()`

### Security Features
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs sanitized with Zod schemas
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of MCP services
- **Process Isolation**: MCP servers run in separate processes
- **Timeout Protection**: Prevents hanging requests
