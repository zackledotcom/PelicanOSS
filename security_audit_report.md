# PelicanOS Security and Code Quality Audit

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive security and code quality audit of the PelicanOS codebase has identified several critical issues that require immediate attention. The application, which integrates with AI models (particularly Ollama) and provides agent-based interactions, contains significant security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and architectural concerns.

The most severe issues include:

1. **Dangerous System Access**: The agent system allows execution of system commands without proper safeguards
2. **Insufficient Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted but the implementation has several flaws
3. **Hardcoded Credentials and Paths**: Multiple instances of hardcoded configuration values
4. **Inadequate Input Validation**: Many IPC handlers lack proper validation
5. **Insecure Process Management**: External processes are spawned with insufficient controls

This report provides detailed findings with specific code references and actionable recommendations prioritized by severity.

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. Dangerous System Access

- **Location**: `/src/main/services/agents.ts` (lines 14-22, 25-32)
- **Issue**: The agent system includes dangerous tools like `system.execute_command` that could allow arbitrary code execution. These tools are only logged with warnings (lines 254-256, 309-310) but not prevented.
- **Impact**: Potential for complete system compromise if an agent is misconfigured or compromised.
- **Recommendation**: Implement a proper permission system that requires explicit user confirmation for dangerous operations. Remove or severely restrict system command execution capabilities.

### 2. Insufficient Encryption

- **Location**: `/src/main/services/agents.ts` (lines 182-183, 201-202, 240-241)
- **Issue**: While the code attempts to encrypt sensitive data, there's no validation of encryption success, no key rotation mechanism, and encrypted data is stored in predictable locations.
- **Impact**: Potential exposure of sensitive agent configurations and audit logs.
- **Recommendation**: Implement proper key management, add encryption validation, use secure storage APIs, and consider adding a key rotation mechanism.

### 3. Hardcoded Credentials and Paths

- **Location**: `/src/main/index.ts` (lines 133-139)
- **Issue**: Service URLs, paths, and ports are hardcoded throughout the codebase.
- **Impact**: Reduced security, flexibility, and portability of the application.
- **Recommendation**: Move all configuration to a secure, environment-specific configuration system with appropriate defaults.

### 4. Inadequate Input Validation

- **Location**: Multiple locations including `/src/main/index.ts` (lines 346-357, 608-625)
- **Issue**: Many IPC handlers lack proper validation of input parameters, particularly for user-provided data.
- **Impact**: Potential for injection attacks, unexpected behavior, and application crashes.
- **Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive input validation using Zod schemas (as done in some parts of the code) consistently across all IPC handlers.

### 5. Insecure Process Management

- **Location**: `/src/main/index.ts` (lines 246-318, 377-410)
- **Issue**: External processes (Ollama, ChromaDB) are spawned with pipe stdio and insufficient validation.
- **Impact**: Potential for command injection, information leakage, and resource exhaustion.
- **Recommendation**: Implement proper process isolation, validate all inputs to spawned processes, and add resource limits.

## High-Priority Issues

### 1. Weak Error Handling

- **Location**: Multiple locations including `/src/main/index.ts` (lines 337-364, 619-623)
- **Issue**: Error handling is inconsistent across the codebase, with some functions exposing raw error details and others silently failing.
- **Impact**: Potential information leakage and reduced reliability.
- **Recommendation**: Standardize error handling, sanitize error messages, and implement proper logging with sensitive data redaction.

### 2. Non-Atomic File Operations

- **Location**: `/src/main/services/agents.ts` (lines 225-242)
- **Issue**: File operations for saving the agent registry are not atomic, risking data corruption if the application crashes during a write operation.
- **Impact**: Potential loss of agent configurations and settings.
- **Recommendation**: Implement atomic file operations using temporary files and rename operations.

### 3. Insufficient Rate Limiting

- **Location**: `/src/main/index.ts` (lines 43-53)
- **Issue**: Rate limiting is implemented for some operations but not consistently applied across all IPC handlers and API calls.
- **Impact**: Potential for denial of service attacks and excessive resource consumption.
- **Recommendation**: Apply consistent rate limiting to all external-facing operations and API calls.

### 4. Weak Random ID Generation

- **Location**: `/src/main/services/ollama.ts` (line 308)
- **Issue**: Random IDs are generated using Math.random() which is not cryptographically secure.
- **Impact**: Potential for ID collisions and predictability.
- **Recommendation**: Use a cryptographically secure random number generator for all ID generation.

### 5. Excessive File Size and Responsibility

- **Location**: `/src/main/index.ts` (750 lines)
- **Issue**: The main index.ts file is excessively large and handles too many responsibilities.
- **Impact**: Reduced maintainability, increased bug risk, and difficulty in testing.
- **Recommendation**: Refactor into smaller, focused modules organized by domain (window management, IPC handlers, service management).

## Medium-Priority Issues

### 1. Limited PII Detection

- **Location**: `/src/main/services/ollama.ts` (lines 83-96)
- **Issue**: The PII detection in sanitizeContent is limited to a few patterns and might miss other sensitive data.
- **Impact**: Potential leakage of undetected sensitive information.
- **Recommendation**: Enhance PII detection with more comprehensive patterns and consider using a dedicated PII detection library.

### 2. Hardcoded Timeouts and Limits

- **Location**: Multiple locations including `/src/main/index.ts` (lines 304, 317, 413)
- **Issue**: Timeout values, retry counts, and other limits are hardcoded throughout the codebase.
- **Impact**: Reduced flexibility and potential for resource exhaustion.
- **Recommendation**: Make these values configurable and set appropriate defaults based on environment.

### 3. Inconsistent Logging

- **Location**: Throughout the codebase
- **Issue**: Logging is inconsistent, with some operations logging extensively and others not at all.
- **Impact**: Difficulty in debugging and monitoring.
- **Recommendation**: Implement a structured logging system with appropriate levels and consistent usage.

### 4. Limited Memory Management

- **Location**: `/src/main/index.ts` (lines 452-496)
- **Issue**: Memory enrichment has limited controls and could lead to excessive memory usage.
- **Impact**: Potential performance degradation and resource exhaustion.
- **Recommendation**: Implement more granular memory controls, add memory usage monitoring, and implement cleanup mechanisms.

### 5. Lack of Comprehensive Testing

- **Issue**: No evidence of automated testing in the examined codebase.
- **Impact**: Increased risk of regressions and undetected bugs.
- **Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests, particularly for security-critical components.
