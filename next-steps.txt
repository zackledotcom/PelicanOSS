Next implementation steps needed:

1. Update src/preload/index.ts to expose the new Gemini CLI IPC methods
2. Create UI components for:
   - Code analysis results
   - Diff preview and approval
   - Project selection interface

Please start with updating the preload script to expose:
- gemini-cli-analyze-project
- gemini-cli-generate-modification  
- gemini-cli-chat-with-context
- gemini-cli-apply-diff

Follow the existing preload patterns in the project.
