You need to scan the PelicanOS codebase for timestamp-related errors and fix them. The user has identified that timestamp validation is causing chat crashes, but this might be happening in multiple places.

TASKS:
1. Search the entire codebase for .toLocaleTimeString() usage without validation
2. Find all Date object usage that might be causing similar crashes
3. Identify the root cause of why invalid Date objects are being created
4. Fix ALL timestamp validation issues throughout the codebase
5. Apply the fixes directly to the files

The main issue is in MessageComponent.tsx line 223 but there are likely others. Please scan and fix systematically.
