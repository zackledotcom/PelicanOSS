URGENT: The chat is STILL broken after all our attempts. 

CURRENT STATUS:
- App starts without errors
- When user sends "hi" message, shows:
  **System** Invalid time
  hi 
  **System** Invalid time
  Error communicating with Ollama

FIXES ALREADY ATTEMPTED:
1. Fixed timestamp validation across 10+ components 
2. Fixed API response format (message -> response)
3. Confirmed Ollama is running and responding correctly via curl
4. Consolidated chat handler is registered

THE PROBLEM PERSISTS. The user is frustrated after 12+ hours of failed attempts.

GEMINI: You need to ACTUALLY FIX this now. Stop analyzing and directly:

1. Find the REAL root cause of why "Error communicating with Ollama" 
2. Fix the timestamp issue causing "Invalid time" 
3. Make the chat work end-to-end
4. Apply ALL fixes to the actual files

Use all available tools to systematically debug and fix this immediately. The user's patience is exhausted.
