URGENT: PelicanOS Project Status Assessment Required

PROJECT: PelicanOS AI Assistant (formerly Puffer)
CURRENT STATE: Multiple fixes applied, need status verification

RECENT ACTIONS COMPLETED:
1. ✅ Timestamp validation fixes applied to MessageComponent.tsx (line 223)
2. ✅ Similar fixes applied to ChatMessageList.tsx and CliMessage.tsx
3. ✅ App now starts without errors according to last assessment
4. ✅ MCP servers properly installed (context7, sequential-thinking, mcp-reasoner, firecrawl)

CURRENT QUESTIONS FOR ASSESSMENT:
1. Are the timestamp validation fixes sufficient to resolve the "Chat Interface Error"?
2. What is the current chat functionality status? Can users send messages without crashes?
3. Are there any remaining critical issues that need immediate attention?
4. What should be the next development priority?
5. Is the multi-AI integration (Ollama, Claude, Gemini) working correctly?

SPECIFIC TECHNICAL CONCERNS:
- IPC handler conflicts (multiple competing handlers)
- Claude DC Service initialization failures
- Service health check failures
- Circuit breaker activations

IMMEDIATE NEED:
- Confirmation that chat interface is now functional
- Identification of any remaining blocking issues
- Next steps for completing the project

Please provide:
1. Current project status assessment
2. Functionality verification results
3. Critical issues that remain
4. Recommended next actions
5. Timeline for project completion

This is a handoff from Claude to Gemini for implementation expertise.
