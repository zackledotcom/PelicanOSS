I have applied timestamp validation fixes to the main chat components:

1. Fixed MessageComponent.tsx line 223 - the critical crash issue
2. Fixed ChatMessageList.tsx line 141 - similar timestamp crash
3. Fixed CliMessage.tsx line 80 - CLI timestamp validation

The app is now starting without errors. Please provide your final assessment:

1. Are these the right fixes for the timestamp validation crashes?
2. Do you see any other critical timestamp issues that need immediate fixing?
3. Is the chat interface likely to work now without the "Chat Interface Error"?
4. What should be the next priority after these timestamp fixes?

Please confirm the fixes are correct and identify any remaining critical issues.
