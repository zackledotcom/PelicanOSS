Gemini CLI - Review and Next Steps

I've created src/main/services/GeminiCliService.ts based on your guidance.

Please:
1. Review the implementation I created
2. Suggest any improvements needed
3. Guide me on creating the IPC handlers next (src/main/handlers/geminiCliHandlers.ts)
4. Advise on preload script updates needed

The GeminiCliService.ts is complete - please help with the next integration steps.
