Please assess this critical PelicanOS chat interface diagnosis:

ROOT CAUSE: Chat interface crashes with 'Chat Interface Error' on first message due to timestamp validation failure in MessageComponent.tsx line 223. The code calls message.timestamp.toLocaleTimeString() without validating if timestamp is a valid Date object.

EVIDENCE: 
- ErrorBoundary catches React crash and shows fallback UI
- Multiple competing IPC handlers despite consolidation attempts  
- Service initialization failures: 'Claude Desktop Commander Service not initialized'
- Circuit breaker activated after 5 failures

PROPOSED FIX:
Replace line 223 in MessageComponent.tsx:
FROM: {message.timestamp.toLocaleTimeString()}
TO: {message.timestamp instanceof Date && !isNaN(message.timestamp.getTime()) ? message.timestamp.toLocaleTimeString() : 'Invalid time'}

QUESTIONS:
1. Do you agree this timestamp validation is the critical blocking issue?
2. Should we fix timestamp first or address handler conflicts simultaneously? 
3. What's your recommended implementation sequence?
4. Any additional concerns with the React error handling pattern?

Please provide your assessment of priority, implementation approach, and timeline estimate.
