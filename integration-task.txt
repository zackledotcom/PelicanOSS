Now create integration to add the CodeAnalysisPanel to the main PelicanOS interface.

Please:
1. Update the main App.tsx to include a Gemini CLI section
2. Add navigation/menu item for the new code analysis feature
3. Show how to integrate it with the existing layout

Make it accessible from the main interface so users can start using Gemini CLI code analysis.
